# Events Management Project

The project was developed using React and Typescript. For the tests, I used Jest along with React
Testing Library. I wasn't sure if I could include more libraries like Vite for optimizing the
experience or more specific libraries for the style like Material UI or TailwindCSS, so I tried to
keep it simple.

## Considerations

A lot of improvements could be made to improve the code, including:

- More tests could be added
- Probably more abstractions could be made
- More attention to mobile responsiveness and accessibility / user experience in general
- Better design and validations (like input field errors, modal confirmations, not allowing to
  select an endDate that it's before the startDate)

For the time spent developing, I wish I could have delivered it sooner, but I spent some time
learning about some of the libraries (like the calendar) and even with the tests because I never had
the opportunity to have a close contact to it on the previous companies that I've worked with.
